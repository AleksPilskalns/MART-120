        <p>The plot is set in 1986, and follows a week long-camping expedition carried out by seven members of a certain university's mystery fiction club. They visit Tsunoshima, the site of a mysterious mass homicide and arson that took place the year prior. The island was at that time the property of eccentric architect Seiji Nakamura, who disappeared after the incident and left behind the bizarrely shaped building known as the Decagon House. The club members resolve themselves to spend a week in this house as they work on their own stories for the club magazine.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, on the mainland, Takaaki Kawaminami, an ex-member of the club, teams up with amateur sleuth Kiyoshi Shimada to unravel the original mystery of Tsunoshima. They wonder if there is any link between the mass homicide that took place in 1985, and the accidental death of fellow club member Chiori Nakamuraâ€”daughter of the same Seiji Nakamura that owned the island and built the Decagon House.</p>
