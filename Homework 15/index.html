  <h2 id="background">Background</h2>

  <p>The game a Day in the Life of a Simp (part 7) came about when amatuer programmer Aleks needed to create an assignment for week 4 of the creative coding class. The assignment required use of <a href=https://code.org/>Code.Org's'</a> app lab. Aleks ended up creating a rather unconventional game. A choose your own story adventure but as a spoof of the dating simulator genre. The romance interests in the game include characters that are ironically characters that nobody would actually choose to date, including but not limited to, a tree, and Shadow the Hedgehog from the game franchise <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog>Sonic The Hedgehog.</a> At least, one hopes nobody would choose to date them.</p>

  <p>It is reported that amateur coder Aleks chose this particular idea for their assignment purely because they thought it would be funny, and because their friend told them to.</p>

  <h2 id="gameplay">Gameplay</h2>

  <p>The gameplay includes clicking buttons to choose which option you want to pick on your choose your own adventure. Very thrilling stuff. </p>
